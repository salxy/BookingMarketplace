    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions at El Bet Baytak</h1> 

    <p>These Terms of Service (“<b>Terms”</b>) are a binding legal agreement between you and El Bet Baytak that govern 
        your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from El Bet Baytak (collectively, the 
        “El Bet Baytak Platform”). When used in these Terms, “El Bet Baytak,” “we,” “us,” or “our”refers 
        to the El Bet Baytak entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.</p>
<br/>
        <p>The El Bet Baytak Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“<b>Members</b>”) to publish, offer, search for,
             and book services. Members who publish and offer services are “<b>Hosts</b>” and Members who search for, book, or use 
             services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations (“<b>Accommodations</b>”), activities, excursions, and events 
             (“<b>Experiences</b>”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “<b>Host Services</b>,” and each Host 
             Service offering, a “<b>Listing</b>”). You must register an account to access and use many features of the El Bet 
             Baytak Platform, and must keep your account information accurate. As the provider of the El Bet Baytak Platform, 
             El Bet Baytak does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. El Bet Baytak is not 
             a party to the contracts concluded directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is El Bet Baytak a real estate 
             broker or insurer. El Bet Baytak is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified 
             in the Payments Terms of Service (“<b>Payment Terms</b>”).</p>
<br/>
        <p>We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy,
            which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern
            any payment services provided to Members by the El Bet Baytak payment entities ("<b>El Bet Baytak Payments</b>").</p>
    <p>If you Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, 
        regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host Services.</p>
    <br/>
        <h3>1. Searching and Booking on El Bet Baytak.</h3>
        <p><b>1.1 Searching.</b> You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, 
            travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search results. 
            Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like 
            price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved 
            Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more. Learn more about search results in our 
            Help Center.</p>
            <br/>
        <p><b>1.2 Booking. </b>When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the 
            Listing price, applicable fees like El Bet Baytak’s service fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items identified 
            during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). You are also agreeing that El Bet Baytak Payments may charge and 
            collect any security deposit identified during checkout. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for 
            Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Host. 
            The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or 
            during checkout form part of your contract with the Host. Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part 
            of a team to provide their Host Services.</p>
            <br/>
        <p><b>1.3 Accommodation Reservations.</b>An Accommodation reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy, and 
            use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: 
            (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable 
            law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, 
            including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.</p>
            <br/>
        <p><b>1.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services.</b>An Experience or other Host Service reservation 
            entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service. You are responsible for confirming that you, 
            and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for 
            informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability 
            to participate, attend, or use the Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person 
            to join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.</p>
            <br/>

            <h3>2. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.</h3>
        <p><b>2.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds. </b> In general, if as a Guest you cancel a reservation, 
            the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. But, 
            in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If 
            something outside your control forces you to cancel a reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or 
            full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue 
            (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full 
            refund under the Guest Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for example 
            Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Policy for details about 
            what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.</p>
            <br/>
        <p><b>2.2 Booking Modifications.</b>Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the El Bet Baytak Platform or direct customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>3. Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.</h3>
        <p><b>3.1 Your Responsibilities. </b> You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>3.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the El Bet Baytak Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 10), including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.</b></p>
        <br/>
        <h3>4. Hosting on El Bet Baytak.</h3>
        <p><b>4.1 Host. </b>As a Host, El Bet Baytak offers you the opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>4.2 Contracting with Guests. </b>When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the El Bet Baytak Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like El Bet Baytak’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking. El Bet Baytak Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>4.3 Independence of Hosts. </b>Your relationship with El Bet Baytak is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of El Bet Baytak, except that El Bet Baytak Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. El Bet Baytak does not direct or control your Host Service, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>5. Managing Your Listing.</h3>
        <p><b>5.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing. </b>The El Bet Baytak Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay. Any offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>5.2 Know Your Legal Obligations. </b>You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle). In some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>5.3 Search Ranking. </b>
        <ul>The ranking of Listings in search results on the El Bet Baytak Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:
            <li>Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),</li>
            <li>Listing characteristics (e.g. price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, Reviews, type of Host Service, Host status, age of the Listing, average Guest popularity),</li>
            <li>Guest booking experience (e.g. customer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking),</li>
            <li>Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and</li>
            <li>Guest preferences (e.g. previous trips, saved Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).</li>
            Search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear on our website. El Bet Baytak may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the El Bet Baytak Platform by paying an additional fee. More information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.
        </ul></p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>5.4 Your ResponsibilitiesYou are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services. You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing. You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the El Bet Baytak Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline Fee Policy. Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the El Bet Baytak Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.</b></p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>5.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization. </b> If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business, or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Host Services is responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms. If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established. If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct El Bet Baytak to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or to send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>5.6 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that hosting carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the El Bet Baytak Platform, offering Host Services, or any interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. You agree that you have had the opportunity to investigate the El Bet Baytak Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or Host Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by El Bet Baytak.</b></p>
